## Procedure

### 1. Content Creation

- **Responsibility:** FINOS Ambassador
- **Description:**
  
  **Identify the Purpose:** Posts should focus on:
  - Promoting FINOS events, meetups, or conferences.
  - Highlighting contributions to FINOS projects.
  - Sharing insights on open-source technologies in finance.
  - Announcing new releases or updates from FINOS.
  
  **Keep it Concise:** Social media content should be direct, engaging, and no longer than necessary. Use short, attention-grabbing statements or questions.
  
  **Hashtags:** Use relevant FINOS and industry-specific hashtags to increase visibility, such as #FINOS, #OpenSource, #Finance, #OpenFinance, #FinTech, #FinancialServices or others that are relevant to the post’s content.
  
  **Visuals:** Where possible, include images, GIFs, or videos to increase engagement. FINOS can provide branded visuals or templates for use.
  
  **Branding:** FINOS logos, project logos, and SIG logos [can be found here](https://github.com/finos/branding).
  
  **Tagging:** Tag FINOS (@FINOSFoundation on Twitter, @FINOS on LinkedIn) and other relevant accounts to increase visibility and cross-promote.
  
  **Call-to-Action (CTA):** Encourage engagement by including a CTA, such as:
  - "Join us at the next FINOS meetup!"
  - "Contribute to our latest open-source project."
  - "Learn more about FINOS’s mission."
  
- **Deliverable:** Social media post draft, including hashtags, visuals, and CTA.

### 2. Post Scheduling and Publishing

- **Responsibility:** FINOS Ambassador
- **Description:**
  
  **Select Optimal Timing:** Post at times when your target audience is most active. Ideal times may vary by platform:
  - LinkedIn: Weekdays between 8 AM and 10 AM or 12 PM and 2 PM.
  - Twitter: Weekdays between 9 AM and 11 AM or 1 PM and 3 PM.
  
  **Frequency:** Aim to post regularly, but ensure that posts are spread out to avoid overwhelming your audience (once or twice per week is a good balance).
  
  **Re-Posting Support:** To amplify reach, share a link to the published post with FINOS so it can be re-posted on official FINOS channels (especially LinkedIn).
  
- **Deliverable:** Social media post scheduled or published live, with link shared to FINOS for potential re-posting.

### 3. Engagement and Interaction

- **Responsibility:** FINOS Ambassador, FINOS POC, and FINOS Marketing
- **Description:**
  
  **Monitor Engagement:** After posting, monitor the post for comments, likes, shares, and interactions. Respond to comments or questions to maintain engagement and foster conversation.
  
  **Amplify the Message:** Share with FINOS and other community members to reshare or engage with your post, engage with their responses and amplify their messages by resharing relevant posts or providing additional commentary.
  
  **Encourage Collaboration:** Promote engagement by inviting followers to share their thoughts, contribute to projects, or ask questions about the content.
  
- **Deliverable:** Ongoing engagement with social media audience.

### 4. Post-Event or Follow-Up Content (If Applicable)

- **Responsibility:** FINOS Ambassador
- **Description:**
  
  **Share Event Highlights:** If the post was related to an event, share a follow-up post with key takeaways, speaker highlights, or a link to the event recording.
